# FULL SCRIPT

## Slide 1 – Welcome

**Orin:**
Good morning, and thank you for being here.
We are **GreenLoop Textiles Ltd.**, based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Our company focuses on recycling textile waste and turning it into high-quality recycled materials.
Today, we will walk you through our company, market opportunity, and financial plan.

---

## Slide 2 – Executive Summary

**Orin:**
GreenLoop collects cutting-room scraps and deadstock from garment factories and converts them into **recycled cotton fiber and polyester-based materials**.

Our location near Savar and Gazipur gives us easy access to large garment factories.
We are officially registered as a Private Limited Company under RJSC.

The global shift toward sustainability creates a major opportunity.
Brands now demand **traceable, certified, and low-carbon materials**, and we aim to meet this growing need.

---

## Slide 3 – Market Analysis

**Orin:**
Bangladesh generates around **400,000 metric tons** of pre-consumer textile waste every year.
This includes cotton scraps, yarn waste, and packaging waste.

Our target for FY 2026 is to process **2,500 metric tons**, which is just **1%** of the total available waste.
This shows strong potential for future expansion.

Demand for recycled materials is growing because of **EU regulations**, global brand commitments, and the need for more sustainable supply chains.
This makes our business both relevant and timely.

---

## Slide 4 – Products & Services

**Orin:**
Our company offers three main products and services.

First, **Recycled Cotton Fiber**, produced through an advanced de-fiberization process.
Factories can blend this fiber with virgin cotton for open-end spinning.

Second, **Recycled Polyester Yarn**, created from PET and packaging waste collected from the supply chain.

Third, we provide **Zero-Waste Consulting** to factories.
We help them improve segregation, organize waste flow, and set up long-term supply agreements.
This ensures stable sourcing for our operation.

## Slide 5 – Funding Strategy: Green Transformation Fund

**Orin:**
To finance our project, we plan to use the **Green Transformation Fund**, or GTF, from Bangladesh Bank.
This fund supports environmentally friendly and energy-efficient industries.

The biggest advantage is the lower interest rate—**4% to 4.5%**, instead of the **10%–12%** typical in commercial loans.
The loan term is up to **10 years**, giving us strong financial flexibility.

Based on our projections, the payback period for this project will be around **4.5 years**, which makes it a good investment for lenders.

---

## Slide 6 – Financial Projections

**Orin:**
Our financial outlook is strong and realistic.

In FY 2026, we expect revenue of **BDT 50 million**, rising to **BDT 57.4 million** in FY 2027.
This represents a growth rate of about **14.8%**.

Gross profit increases from **BDT 20 million** to **BDT 22.96 million**, and net profit rises from **BDT 7.25 million** to **BDT 8.32 million**.

Our three-year IRR is estimated at **21.5%**, and the cumulative profit from FY 2026 to FY 2028 is **BDT 25.48 million**.

## Slide 7 – Risk Analysis

**Sumaiya:**
Thank you, Orin.
I will now explain the key risks and our mitigation strategies.

**Economic Risk:**
Inflation—especially energy costs—can affect our expenses.
To reduce this impact, we will use energy-efficient machinery and plan utility costs in advance.

**Market Risk:**
If global garment demand slows down, waste availability may decrease.
To manage this, we will diversify into other waste categories such as **jute** and **leather**.

**Operational Risk:**
Machinery breakdowns can interrupt production.
We follow a preventive maintenance schedule and maintain a **5% spare-parts reserve** to reduce downtime.

---

## Slide 8 – Roadmap

**Sumaiya:**
Here is our development roadmap.

By **Q1 2026**, we plan to finish the full GTF loan application and finalize machinery selection.
By **Q2 2026**, we aim to sign agreements with at least five garment factories for waste supply.

Our target for installation, testing, and full commercial operation is **Q4 2026**.

---

## Slide 9 – Founding Team

**Sumaiya:**
Our team brings strong experience in circularity, technology, and operations.

Orin leads strategy and technology, with experience in digital innovation.
I lead circularity and ESG integration, focusing on waste-management systems in the RMG sector.
