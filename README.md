## **Slide 1: Cover Slide**

**Orin:**
“Good morning. I’m **Orin Khan**, CEO of **GreenLoop Textiles Ltd.**
Thank you for joining us today.

GreenLoop exists to transform Bangladesh’s pre-consumer textile waste into certified recycled fiber—unlocking profitability, compliance, and climate impact for the entire RMG ecosystem.

I’m joined by my colleague **Sumaiya**, our Head of Circularity and Operations.
I’ll begin by covering the vision, market structure, and business strategy. After that, Sumaiya will walk you through operations, finances, and execution.”

## **Slide 2: Company & Business Type**

**Orin:**
“GreenLoop is a **B2B circular textile manufacturer**, not a pilot or NGO project.
We convert **cutting-room waste** from garment factories into **GRS-certified recycled cotton fiber** for spinning mills.

With planned capacity of **2,500 metric tons per year**, we will supply enough fiber for **50 million t-shirts annually**, aligned with **GOTS**, **GRS**, and **LEED** certification pathways.”

## **Slide 3: Capital Investment & Structure**

**Orin:**
“Our total project requirement is **BDT 100 million**.
The core machinery—optical sorting, shredding, and cleaning lines—represent the majority of the investment.

Our advantage is financial leverage:

* **95% financed through the Green Transformation Fund (GTF)**
* **BDT 50,00,000 (50 lakh)** as founder equity for pre-operational setup

This gives us significant capital efficiency with minimal dilution and strong eligibility for government-backed sustainability financing.”

## **Slide 4: Market Analysis**

**Orin:**
“We’re operating at the intersection of three converging forces:

1. **Regulatory pressure**:
   The EU requires all textiles sold by 2030 to be recyclable, driving brands toward recycled inputs.

2. **Buyer expectations**:
   H&M, Zara, and PVH are demanding higher recycled content and offering premiums for zero-waste certifications.

3. **Bangladesh’s national ambition**:
   The country aims to be the world’s greenest garment hub, with GTF as a catalyst.

Bangladesh generates **400,000+ metric tons** of pre-consumer textile waste annually.
We are capturing just **0.6%** to generate **BDT 50 million revenue** in Year 1.”

## **Slide 5: Products & Price Strategy**

**Orin:**
“We operate under a dual-revenue model:

**1. Recycled Cotton Fiber**
GRS-certified fiber sold to spinning mills at **BDT 180–220 per kg**.
This remains **30–40% cheaper** than virgin cotton.

**2. Zero-Waste Certification Service**
Factories receive third-party-verified proof of responsible waste recycling.
This is high-margin, compliance-driven, and strengthens our feedstock security.

Together, these create a self-reinforcing supply loop where factories benefit from compliance, mills benefit from cost reductions, and we benefit from stable input quality.”

## **Slide 6: Marketing & Sales Strategy**

**Orin:**
“Our GTM strategy balances supply stability and high-demand buyers:

* We are signing **12-month exclusive MOUs** with **5 BGMEA member factories**, offering free waste pickup and digital impact dashboards.
* We sell directly to spinning mills, emphasizing **cost efficiency**, **compliance reliability**, and **traceability**.

Our vertically controlled system—from factory bin to fiber bale—gives us competitive defensibility against local informal recyclers.

With the strategic overview complete, I’ll now invite Sumaiya to walk you through the operational, financial, and execution side of GreenLoop.”

**Orin turns slightly toward her.**
**Orin:**
“Sumaiya, over to you.”

# **(Sumaiya Takes Over)**

## **Slide 7: Human Resources & Staffing**

**Sumaiya:**
“Thank you, Orin.

Our operational structure is optimized for efficiency and certification readiness.
By FY26, we plan for **60–70 employees**:

* **50%** in factory operations and quality control
* **40%** in sourcing, field officers, and partner factory coordination
* **10%** in management, compliance, and finance

This ratio keeps overhead low while strengthening on-ground execution—critical in the RMG ecosystem.”

---

## **Slide 8: Financial Projections**

**Sumaiya:**
“Our financial model is built on conservative assumptions and validated demand.

* **Year 1**: BDT 50 million revenue | BDT 7.25 million profit
* **Year 2**: BDT 57.4 million revenue | BDT 8.32 million profit
* **Year 3**: BDT 65.9 million revenue | BDT 9.91 million profit

This results in:

* **21.5% IRR**
* **25.5 million cumulative profit by Year 3**
* **Positive cash flow by Month 10**
* **Break-even in Q3 of Year 1**”

---

## **Slide 9: Risk Analysis**

**Sumaiya:**
“We’ve tested our model under multiple risk scenarios:

* **Inflation exposure** reduced through forward-purchase energy contracts.
* **Feedstock shortage** mitigated through diversification into jute and leather waste.
* **Machinery downtime** addressed by a dedicated **5% spares reserve** and OEM service agreements.

Each mitigation is grounded in hands-on industry experience.”

---

## **Slide 10: Conclusion & Roadmap**

**Sumaiya:**
“Our roadmap for 2026 is execution-focused:

* **Q1**: GTF disbursement and machinery procurement
* **Q2**: Waste MOUs with anchor BGMEA factories
* **Q4**: Commercial fiber production begins

By the end of our first operational year, GreenLoop becomes profitable and ready to scale to Chittagong and Gazipur.”

## **Slide 11: Founding Team**

**Orin and Sumaiya step forward.**

**Orin:**
“I bring 8 years of digital innovation experience with BGMEA, scaling platform solutions inside 200+ factories.”

**Sumaiya:**
“And I’ve led national ESG and circularity programs across 50+ RMG units, bridging technical execution with sustainability compliance.”

**Orin:**
“Together, our combined expertise makes GreenLoop both scalable and investment-ready.”

## **Slide 12: Q&A**

**Sumaiya:**
“We welcome your questions.”

## **Slide 13: Thank You**

**Orin:**
“GreenLoop is more than a business—it’s a national opportunity.”

**Sumaiya:**
“We turn 400,000 tons of textile waste into value, jobs, and climate leadership.”

**Orin:**
“Thank you for your time.”
