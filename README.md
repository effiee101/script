### **Slide 2: Executive Summary**

**Orin:**
“Our business is simple: we take **cutting room scraps and deadstock** and make new fibers.
We are located near **Savar and Gazipur**, close to major factories.
GreenLoop is a **Private Limited Company**.

Bangladesh is a **top green garment hub**, and factories need **sustainable materials**.

**Why we are unique and effective:**
